#---> print(object,sep,end,file,flush)
#print has 5 parameters

#object --->the value to be printed is object
#sep---> seperator
#EG
#a = 8
#b = 9
#c = 89
# print(a,b,c, sep='$')

#end--->which is used to addthe string at the end of the value,
# # It will not keep the command to stay in same line
#EG:
#print(str(a),b,end='%%')
#print(str(c))

# ! ----> variables
# ? variables is a name which is used to identify the value of variable
